# Design a function - you can pick any subject and you can even make up the equations as long as they conceptually make sense

```         
-   Make sure it has at least 2 inputs and 1 parameter (ideally
    more) and at least 2 outputs
-   Code your function in R, save as a R file in subdirectory called
    R
-   Make sure you include documentation (both at the top as we've
    shown in past examples, and inline)
-   Include some error checking
```

```{r}

```

# In an Quatro file, generate some data for 2 of the function inputs

```         
-   use a *for* loop to run the function for the data
-   repeat the "looping" using something from the "purrr" package
-   Graph results (you can decide what the most interesting way to
    graph - you just need to make one graph)
    
    
```

```{r}

```

# Write at least 2 tests for your function; store in a separate test file

```{r}

```

# Put this in a git repo that includes an R subdirectory, a tests subsdirectory and your Quatro file and submit the link on Canvas (you can put all of this in a new git repo or a subdirectory of an existing git repo)
